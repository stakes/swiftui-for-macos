# SwiftUI for MacOS Resources

Examples and resources about SwiftUI, specifically focused on building Mac OS apps.

Most of the tutorials, example projects, and resources I've found out there are focused on iOS: but not all of them! [I asked the internet for some tips](https://twitter.com/stakelon/status/1292228094871232513) and pulled together what everyone shared with me here, as well as a few that I found on my own. I'll try to keep this updated as I find more good stuff along the way. I'll also make note of the examples that work with Xcode 11.
